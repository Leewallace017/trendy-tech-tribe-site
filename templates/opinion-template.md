<!--
IMAGE SOURCING FOR OPINION PIECES:

Similar to deep-dive - conceptual/thematic:

1. BEST: AI-generated thematic image
   - Reflects the debate/controversy
   - Example: "Two paths diverging, business decision concept"
   - Example: "Balance scales, tech ethics concept art"
   - Credit: "AI Generated Image"

2. GOOD: Relevant news image if opinion is about specific event
   - Company/product if opinion addresses it
   - Credit appropriately (press release, etc.)

3. ACCEPTABLE: Conceptual Unsplash
   - Search for themes (debate, innovation, disruption, etc.)
   - Avoid generic business stock photos
   - Credit: "Photo by [Name] on Unsplash"

NOTE: Opinion pieces should have distinctive images that signal "commentary"
rather than straight news. Abstract/conceptual works well.
