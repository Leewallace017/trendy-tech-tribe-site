## Key Takeaways

- **The Milestone**: For the first time in history, global demand for all three fossil fuels (oil, gas, coal) has peaked before 2030.
- **The Driver**: China's massive pivot to EVs and solar is the primary cause. As the world's biggest energy consumer shifts, the world shifts.
- **The Consequence**: Oil prices may become volatile as producers fight for market share in a shrinking pie.

## Introduction

"Peak Oil" used to mean the day we ran out of oil. Now, it means the day we stop *wanting* it.

According to the International Energy Agency's (IEA) late 2025 report, that day is today.

Despite growing economies in India and Africa, the efficiency gains in the West and the electrification of China have created a ceiling. We aren't going to stop using oil tomorrow, but we will never use more than we did in 2024.

## The China Factor

China is the story. In 2025, **50% of all new cars sold in China were NEVs (New Energy Vehicles)**. They installed more solar panels in one year than the US has in its entire history.

When the world's factory goes green, the demand for coal and oil collapses.

## Economic Shockwaves

This transition isn't just environmental; it's geopolitical.
- **Petrostates**: Countries reliant on oil revenue (Russia, Saudi Arabia) face a "ticking clock" to diversify their economies.
- **Stranded Assets**: Trillions of dollars in oil exploration projects may never turn a profit if demand falls faster than expected.

## The Long Tail

The decline will be slow. We will be burning oil for decades. But the era of *growth* is over. The energy transition has moved from "beginning" to "mid-game."
