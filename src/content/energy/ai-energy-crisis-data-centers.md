## Key Takeaways

- **The Scale**: A single ChatGPT query uses 10x the energy of a Google search. Multiply that by billions, and you break the grid.
- **The bottleneck**: It's not chips; it's transformers. Utilities cannot build transmission lines fast enough to power new gigawatt-scale data centers.
- **The Solution**: Tech giants are going off-grid. Microsoft and Amazon are investing billions in **Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)**—mini nuclear plants.

## Introduction

We thought the limit to AI would be intelligence. It turns out, it's electricity.

In late 2025, the "AI Energy Crisis" is the biggest topic in Silicon Valley. Training a model like GPT-5 requires the energy output of a small city. Running it (inference) requires even more.

Data centers now account for **4% of global electricity consumption**, doubling in just three years.

## The Nuclear Renaissance

Renewables (solar/wind) are great, but they are intermittent. AI needs 24/7 baseload power. Batteries are too expensive for this scale.

Enter Nuclear.
- **Microsoft**: Signed a deal to restart Three Mile Island (yes, really) to power its AI cloud.
- **Google**: Investing in fusion startups and SMRs.

Big Tech has effectively become the new utility sector. They are funding the next generation of clean energy infrastructure because they have no choice.

## The Irony

There is a bitter irony here. We are building AI to help us solve climate change (optimizing grids, designing materials), but the *creation* of that AI is currently driving up emissions.

Google's carbon emissions rose 48% in the last 5 years, largely due to AI.

## The Future

We are heading toward a bifurcated grid: one for the people, and one for the machines. The question is, who pays for the upgrade?
