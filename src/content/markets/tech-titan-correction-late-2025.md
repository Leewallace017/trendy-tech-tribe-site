## Key Takeaways

- **The Crash**: The "Magnificent Seven" lost $2 Trillion in market cap in November 2025.
- **The Cause**: "Capex Fatigue." Companies are spending billions on AI chips, but software revenue isn't growing fast enough to justify it.
- **The Outlook**: This isn't a dot-com crash; it's a reality check. The market is separating the tool-builders (Nvidia) from the tool-users.

## Introduction

"Buy the rumor, sell the news." For two years, Wall Street bought the AI rumor. Now, they are selling the reality.

The Q3 2025 earnings season was a bloodbath for expectations. Tech giants posted record profits, but their *guidance* spooked the street. The message was clear: "We are spending more on AI, and it will take longer to pay off."

## The ROI Problem

Sequoia Capital famously asked, "Where is the $600 Billion?" (The revenue needed to justify AI infrastructure spend).

In late 2025, the answer is: "Still coming."
Enterprises are adopting AI, but they aren't paying premium prices for it yet. Copilot subscriptions have stalled. The "productivity boom" hasn't translated to immediate bottom-line growth for the software vendors.

## Winners and Losers

- **Losers**: SaaS companies who slapped "AI" on their product and raised prices. The market is punishing them.
- **Winners**: Hardware and Infrastructure. Data centers, chip fabs, and energy providers are still printing money because the build-out must continue.

## Is it Over?

No. The internet didn't end when the dot-com bubble burst in 2000. It just got real.
The "AI Casino" is closed. The "AI Factory" is open for business. Expect volatility, but don't bet against the future.
