## What Happened

Nvidia reports Q4 fiscal 2025 earnings on November 26. Wall Street expects revenue of $37.1 billion (up 70% year-over-year) and earnings per share of $0.82. The company has beaten estimates for eight consecutive quarters, but this time feels different.

The setup: Nvidia's stock is up 180% year-to-date, trading at 25x forward sales—a premium valuation justified only if AI infrastructure spending continues accelerating. Recent commentary from Meta, Microsoft, and Google suggests growth may be plateauing.

## Why It Matters

**This report will answer three critical questions:**

### 1. Is AI infrastructure spending slowing?

Hyperscalers (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta) have collectively announced $200+ billion in capital expenditure for 2025, mostly on Nvidia GPUs. But recent earnings calls showed signs of hesitation:

- Meta said it's "evaluating the efficiency" of AI infrastructure spending
- Microsoft highlighted cost optimization efforts
- Google mentioned "digesting existing capacity" before expanding further

If Nvidia's data center revenue growth decelerates significantly (below 60-70% year-over-year), it signals hyperscalers are tapping the brakes. That would trigger a broader sell-off in AI infrastructure stocks (Broadcom, ASML, AMD).

### 2. Can Nvidia maintain gross margins?

Nvidia's data center GPUs command 70-80% gross margins—extraordinary for a hardware business. This reflects near-monopoly pricing power on the H100 and H200 chips.

Competition is coming:
- AMD's MI300X is gaining traction (Meta just placed a large order)
- Google and Amazon are designing custom AI chips to reduce Nvidia dependence
- Chinese competitors are targeting international markets

If gross margins compress below 70%, it suggests pricing power is eroding. Even a 2-3 percentage point decline could knock $100 billion off Nvidia's market cap.

### 3. Is the Blackwell ramp on track?

Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell GPUs were supposed to ship in Q3 but faced delays due to design changes. Management now says volume production starts in Q4.

Wall Street wants confirmation that:
- Blackwell yields are improving (manufacturing is working at scale)
- Customer demand is as strong as H100/H200 demand was
- Supply chain can support rapid ramp-up

Any hint of further delays would be interpreted as a sign that Nvidia's execution edge over competitors is narrowing.

## What to Watch Next

**Guidance is more important than Q4 results**

Nvidia will likely beat Q4 estimates (they always do). What matters is Q1 2026 guidance. Analysts expect $43-45 billion in revenue. Anything below $42 billion would signal a meaningful slowdown and likely tank the stock.

**Customer concentration risk**

Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon collectively account for 40-50% of Nvidia's revenue. If any single hyperscaler cuts spending, it materially impacts results. Listen for commentary on customer diversification and enterprise adoption trends.

**Geopolitical headwinds**

Export restrictions on AI chips to China tightened in October. Nvidia previously derived 20-25% of data center revenue from China. New restrictions could cut this by half. Guidance should clarify the revenue impact.

**Valuation reality check**

At 25x sales, Nvidia is priced for perfection. Any sign of slowing growth, margin pressure, or execution stumbles could trigger a sharp correction. The broader AI trade (Broadcom, ASML, AMD, Super Micro) would follow.

Conversely, if Nvidia confirms that demand remains robust, Blackwell is ramping smoothly, and guidance exceeds expectations, it validates the "AI spending will continue for years" thesis and likely sends the entire sector higher.

---

**My take**: Expect volatility. Nvidia has consistently beat-and-raised for two years, setting nearly impossible expectations. Even a strong quarter could disappoint if guidance is merely "good" instead of "exceptional." If you're holding for the long term, this earnings report won't change the AI mega-trend. But if you're trading around the event, prepare for 10-15% swings in either direction.

The report drops after market close on November 26. Conference call at 5 PM ET.
