## What Happened

Apple rolled out visionOS 2.2 this week, introducing Spatial Personas—a feature that lets Vision Pro users appear as life-sized, three-dimensional avatars in shared virtual spaces. Unlike the floating window-based personas from launch, Spatial Personas can move around a virtual room, making eye contact, and interact with shared objects.

The update also includes support for up to five simultaneous users in a spatial environment, collaborative app experiences, and improved hand tracking for more natural gestures during virtual meetings.

## Why It Matters

This is the first major step toward Apple's vision of spatial computing replacing traditional video calls. The key differences from Zoom or Teams:

**Presence and scale**: Your colleagues appear life-sized in your physical space rather than trapped in a 2D rectangle. This creates a sense of actual presence that's notably different from traditional video.

**Spatial audio**: Voices come from where people are positioned in your virtual room. Turn your head, and the audio shifts naturally—just like real life.

**Shared context**: Everyone can look at the same 3D object, point at specific details, and walk around it together. This beats screen sharing for design reviews, architecture walkthroughs, or product demos.

For remote teams, this could be the first real alternative to in-person collaboration. Early testers report that 30-minute meetings feel less draining than equivalent Zoom calls, likely because your brain processes spatial presence differently than staring at a grid of faces.

## What to Watch Next

**Adoption barriers remain high**: At $3,499, Vision Pro is still an enterprise-only device for most buyers. But if Spatial Personas proves valuable for remote teams, we could see companies start expensing headsets the same way they do laptops.

**Competitors will respond**: Meta has been pushing Horizon Workrooms for years with limited success. Apple's implementation is more polished, but Meta's Quest 3 costs $499. Expect Meta to copy this feature and undercut on price.

**The app ecosystem needs to catch up**: Only a handful of apps support collaborative spatial experiences right now. Apple, Zoom, Microsoft, and others need to build out their visionOS offerings before this becomes a daily driver for teams.

If you're in product design, architecture, or any field where 3D visualization matters, Vision Pro just became significantly more interesting. For everyone else, wait for version 2—and a lower price point.
