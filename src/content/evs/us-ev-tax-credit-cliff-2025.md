## Key Takeaways

- **The Threat**: Political shifts in Washington have put the Inflation Reduction Act's $7,500 EV credit in danger of repeal.
- **The Impact**: Analysts predict a 30% drop in US EV sales if the credit vanishes.
- **The Winner**: Ironically, **Tesla** might benefit the most. They are the only profitable EV maker who can afford to lower prices to offset the loss.

## Introduction

For years, the $7,500 federal tax credit has been the training wheels of the US EV market. It made expensive battery technology palatable for the middle class.

In late 2025, those training wheels are about to be kicked off.

With a shifting political landscape, the subsidies are being targeted as "wasteful spending." The market is reacting with panic. Dealerships are seeing a rush of buyers trying to lock in credits before the new year, creating a temporary "sugar high" in sales.

## The "Tesla Effect"

If the credits go away, legacy automakers (Ford, GM, Hyundai) are in trouble. They are still losing money on every EV they sell. The credit was their lifeline to price competitiveness.

Tesla, however, has industry-leading margins.
- **Scenario**: Credit disappears.
- **Legacy Auto**: Must raise prices or lose billions.
- **Tesla**: Can cut prices by $7,500 to maintain volume and *still* break even.

This policy shift could inadvertently cement Tesla's monopoly while bankrupting the competition's EV divisions.

## What Should You Do?

If you are in the market for an EV, the advice is simple: **Buy now.**

The era of government-subsidized driving is ending. The era of pure market competition is beginning. It's going to be messy, brutal, and expensive—but it might finally force the industry to stand on its own two feet.
