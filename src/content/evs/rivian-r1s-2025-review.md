## Quick Verdict

The Rivian R1S is the most compelling three-row electric SUV on the market. It drives like a sports car, handles actual off-road terrain, charges faster than most competitors, and has build quality that rivals luxury brands. The main downside? Starting at $85,000 (and approaching $100K as tested), it's priced for early adopters with deep pockets.

**Rating: 9/10**

If you need three rows, want serious capability, and can afford the premium, the R1S is the clear choice. For budget-conscious buyers, the Tesla Model Y or Kia EV9 make more sense.

## Real-World Experience

### Driving Dynamics

This is where the R1S surprises. At 7,000 pounds, it has no business feeling this agile. Credit Rivian's skateboard EV platform and adaptive air suspension.

**On pavement**: The R1S corners flat, with precise steering feedback you don't expect from a three-row SUV. Sport mode firms up the suspension and sharpens throttle response, making it genuinely fun on twisty roads. The instant torque from dual motors (850 hp) makes highway merging effortless.

**Off-road**: We tested on moderate trails—rutted fire roads and rocky inclines. The R1S adjusted ride height automatically, maintained traction on loose surfaces, and navigated obstacles that would scrape most crossovers. If you actually use the off-road capability, this is unmatched in the EV space.

**Comfort**: In Conserve or All-Purpose modes, the air suspension soaks up rough pavement beautifully. Road noise is well-controlled, though the optional 21" wheels transmit more impact harshness than the standard 20s.

### Range and Charging

**EPA vs. reality**: Rivian claims 330 miles. Over three weeks of mixed driving (60% highway, 40% city), we averaged 2.4 miles/kWh, yielding about 320 real-world miles on the 135 kWh pack. That's 97% of EPA—impressively accurate.

Cold weather impact: Testing in 40°F weather reduced range by roughly 15%. In summer heat, expect closer to EPA estimates.

**Charging speed**: The R1S peaks at 220 kW on capable DC fast chargers. In practice:
- 10% to 80% in 35 minutes (Electrify America 350 kW charger)
- 20% to 60% in 20 minutes (useful road trip top-up)

This is faster than most competitors except the Hyundai/Kia 800V platform vehicles. The Rivian Adventure Network (Rivian's proprietary chargers) is expanding but still sparse compared to Tesla Superchargers.

**Home charging**: On a 240V/50A circuit, the R1S adds about 25 miles of range per hour. Overnight charging easily handles daily driving.

### Interior and Technology

**Build quality**: Better than expected. Panel gaps are tight, materials feel premium (stitched vegan leather, real wood, metal accents), and there are no squeaks or rattles even on rough roads. This matches or exceeds Audi/BMW fit and finish.

**Space**:
- **First row**: Excellent. Comfortable seats, good visibility, tons of headroom.
- **Second row**: Spacious. Three adults fit comfortably. Sliding second row adjusts legroom vs. third-row access.
- **Third row**: Tight for adults, fine for kids under 12. This is the R1S's main compromise—the third row works for occasional use but isn't ideal for daily adult occupancy.

**Infotainment**: The 16" center screen runs Rivian's custom software. It's fast, logically organized, and avoids Tesla's everything-in-submenus approach. Physical buttons for climate control are a huge plus. Wireless CarPlay/Android Auto arrived via software update earlier this year.

**Driver assist**: Rivian's Highway Assist (adaptive cruise + lane centering) works well on marked roads but isn't as confident as Tesla FSD or GM Super Cruise. It requires frequent steering input and occasionally ping-pongs in lanes. Good enough for long highway drives, but not hands-off.

### Practicality

**Storage**:
- Front trunk: 11.1 cubic feet (fits two large suitcases)
- Gear tunnel: 12 cubic feet (unique pass-through storage behind front wheels—great for skis, camp chairs, muddy gear)
- Cargo area: 88 cubic feet with third row folded, 46 cubic feet with it up

Total storage volume beats most competitors. The Gear Tunnel is a standout feature—it's genuinely useful for keeping dirty items separate from the main cabin.

**Towing**: Rated for 7,700 lbs. We didn't tow during testing, but Rivian includes a built-in tow hitch and the software calculates range impact based on trailer weight. Expect 40-50% range reduction when towing near the max rating.

## Pros

✅ **Outstanding driving dynamics** for a three-row SUV
✅ **Accurate range estimates** and fast DC charging
✅ **Excellent build quality** and premium materials
✅ **Unique features** like Gear Tunnel and Camp Mode
✅ **Genuine off-road capability** (if you need it)
✅ **Physical climate controls** instead of all-touch interface

## Cons

❌ **High price** ($85K base, easily over $95K with options)
❌ **Third-row space** cramped for adults
❌ **Rivian Adventure Network** still expanding
❌ **No hands-free driving** mode (Highway Assist requires input)
❌ **Efficiency lags competitors** (Kia EV9 gets better miles/kWh)

## Who Should Buy This

**Best for:**
- Families who need three rows and want EV ownership
- Outdoor enthusiasts who actually use off-road capability
- Tech-forward buyers willing to pay a premium for a purpose-built EV
- Current luxury SUV owners (X5, GLE, Q7) considering the switch to electric

**Skip if:**
- You're budget-conscious (consider Kia EV9, Hyundai Ioniq 7, or VW ID.Buzz)
- You need spacious third-row seating for adults (get a minivan or Volvo EX90)
- You rarely charge at home (the charging network isn't as mature as Tesla's)
- You want hands-free highway driving (wait for better driver assist)

## Alternatives to Consider

**Tesla Model X**: Faster, better charging network, superior Autopilot. But aging design, inconsistent build quality, and Falcon Wing doors are polarizing. Starting price is similar ($80K).

**Kia EV9**: Significantly cheaper ($56K base), more interior space, faster charging (800V architecture). But less engaging to drive, lower towing capacity, and no off-road chops.

**BMW iX**: More luxurious interior, better tech. But worse range, slower charging, less cargo space, and costs $10K more.

**Volvo EX90** (late 2025): Will offer better third-row space and Volvo safety tech. But expect lower performance and less cargo flexibility.

## Where to Buy

Order directly through [Rivian's website](https://rivian.com). Current delivery time: 6-8 weeks for Dual Motor AWD, 10-12 weeks for Quad Motor.

No dealer markup (Rivian sells direct). Test drives available at Rivian service centers in major metros.

**Final take**: The R1S is the electric SUV I'd actually recommend to friends—if they can afford it. It balances capability, practicality, and driving enjoyment better than any competitor. But at $85K+, this remains a premium choice. For most buyers, waiting 12-18 months for prices to drop or competition to catch up makes sense.
