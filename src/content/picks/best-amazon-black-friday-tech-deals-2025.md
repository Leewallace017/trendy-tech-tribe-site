## Quick Picks

- **Best Overall**: [Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BP9MDCQZ?tag=trendytecht0a-20) - The ultimate streaming upgrade at a rock-bottom price.
- **Best Wearable**: [Apple Watch Series 11](https://amzn.to/3K6pETX) - The king of smartwatches just got cheaper.

## What to Look For

When shopping for tech on Black Friday, keep your wits about you:

1.  **Ignore the "Original Price"**: Retailers love to inflate the "before" price to make the deal look better. Use price trackers like CamelCamelCamel.
2.  **Check the Model Year**: Don't buy a 2021 TV just because it's 50% off. Tech ages like milk, not wine.
3.  **Extended Return Windows**: Make sure you have until January to return it, just in case buyer's remorse sets in.
