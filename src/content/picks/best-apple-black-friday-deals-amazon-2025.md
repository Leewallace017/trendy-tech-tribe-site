## Quick Picks

- **Best iPhone Deal**: [iPhone 15 Pro Max (Renewed, 512GB)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CRJK7V6D?tag=trendytecht0a-20) - Premium flagship at a fraction of the cost.
- **Best iPhone on Sale**: [iPhone 16 (256GB)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DPDJ2DK8?tag=trendytecht0a-20) - Last year's model with great features at a discount.
- **Best Laptop Value**: [MacBook Air 13" M4 (256GB)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZD9S5GC?tag=trendytecht0a-20) - 25% off the latest M4 chip.
- **Best Big Screen Laptop**: [MacBook Air 15" M4 (512GB)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZDB168B?tag=trendytecht0a-20) - Maximum screen and storage.
- **Best Wearable**: [Apple Watch Ultra 2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSVGDV7Q?tag=trendytecht0a-20) - Last year's Ultra model at 23% off.

## What to Look For

Apple products rarely go on sale, so Black Friday is your best shot at scoring a deal. Here's what to keep in mind:

1. **iPhone 17 Not on Sale**: The current iPhone 17 (2025) isn't discounted for Black Friday. The iPhone 16 from 2024 is what's on sale.
2. **Apple Watch Ultra 3 Not on Sale**: The current Apple Watch Ultra 3 (2025) isn't discounted. The Ultra 2 from 2023 is on sale.
3. **Renewed vs. New**: Amazon Renewed Premium offers like-new iPhones at significant discounts with full warranty. Great for flagship models.
4. **M4 Chip is the Real Deal**: The 2025 MacBook Air with M4 is a massive upgrade over M3. Built for Apple Intelligence, it's faster, more efficient, and future-proof.
5. **Check the Storage**: 256GB fills up fast. If you're a creative or store lots of files, spring for the 512GB model.
6. **Color Choices**: All MacBooks come in multiple colors (Midnight, Starlight, Sky Blue, Silver). Choose based on your preference - they're all the same price.
