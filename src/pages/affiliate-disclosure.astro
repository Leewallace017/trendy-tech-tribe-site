        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: {lastUpdated}</p>

        <section>
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Trendy Tech Tribe ("we," "us," or "our") participates in affiliate marketing programs. This means that we may earn commissions from qualifying purchases made through links on our website. This disclosure is provided in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) guidelines on endorsements and testimonials.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>What Are Affiliate Links?</h2>
          <p>
            Affiliate links are special tracking links that allow us to earn a commission when you click on them and make a purchase from the merchant's website. These links do not cost you anything extra—the price you pay is the same whether you use our affiliate link or visit the retailer directly.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you click an affiliate link and make a purchase, we may receive a small percentage of the sale as a commission. This helps support our website operations, content creation, and allows us to continue providing free content to our readers.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Amazon Associates Program</h2>
          <p>
            Trendy Tech Tribe is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an Amazon Associate, we earn from qualifying purchases. This means that when you click on an Amazon product link on our site and make a purchase on Amazon, we receive a small commission at no additional cost to you.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Other Affiliate Programs</h2>
          <p>
            In addition to Amazon Associates, we may participate in other affiliate programs from time to time, including but not limited to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Technology retailers and e-commerce platforms</li>
            <li>Software and service providers</li>
            <li>Consumer electronics manufacturers</li>
            <li>Other relevant affiliate networks</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We will update this disclosure as we add new affiliate relationships.

          <h2>Our Promise to You</h2>

          <h3>Editorial Independence</h3>
          <p>
            Our recommendations are based on genuine research, testing, and editorial judgment. We only recommend products and services that we believe will provide value to our readers. Affiliate relationships do not influence our editorial content or product reviews.
          </p>

          <h3>Honest Reviews</h3>
          <p>
            We provide honest, unbiased reviews and recommendations. If a product has flaws or limitations, we will clearly state them. Our goal is to help you make informed purchasing decisions, not simply to generate commissions.
          </p>

          <h3>Transparency</h3>
          <p>
            We believe in full transparency about our affiliate relationships. Articles containing affiliate links will include a disclosure notice. We clearly identify sponsored content and distinguish it from our regular editorial content.
          </p>

          <h3>No Extra Cost to You</h3>
          <p>
            Using our affiliate links does not increase the price you pay for products or services. In many cases, we negotiate exclusive discounts or deals that can actually save you money.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>How to Identify Affiliate Links</h2>
          <p>
            We make it easy to identify content that contains affiliate links:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Articles with product recommendations and reviews typically include affiliate links</li>
            <li>Gift guides, buying guides, and "best of" lists often contain affiliate links</li>
            <li>Individual product reviews may include affiliate links to purchase the reviewed item</li>
            <li>A disclosure statement appears at the bottom of our website footer</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Price Accuracy and Availability</h2>
          <p>
            Product prices and availability mentioned in our articles are accurate as of the publication date but may change over time. We are not responsible for price changes, product availability, or merchant terms after publication.
          </p>
          <p>
            Always verify current pricing and availability on the retailer's website before making a purchase. Sale prices, discounts, and promotional offers are time-limited and subject to change without notice.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Product Testing and Research</h2>
          <p>
            Whenever possible, we base our recommendations on:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Hands-on testing:</strong> Direct experience with products we review</li>
            <li><strong>Expert research:</strong> Analysis of specifications, user reviews, and industry reports</li>
            <li><strong>Comparison shopping:</strong> Evaluation of multiple options before recommending products</li>
            <li><strong>Long-term usage:</strong> Assessment of product durability and real-world performance</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In cases where we haven't personally tested a product, we clearly indicate this and base recommendations on thorough research, expert opinions, and verified user feedback.
          </p>
