# Quick Reference - Daily Content Creation

## Pre-Writing Checklist

- [ ] Choose topic (newsworthy or evergreen)
- [ ] Select appropriate template
- [ ] Identify 3+ reputable sources
- [ ] Generate or find suitable image (see Image Workflow below)
- [ ] For product articles: verify current Amazon pricing

---

## Required Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: "Compelling Title (60 chars max)"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
author: "Trendy Tech Tribe Staff"
category: "[Tech & Innovation|AI & Automation|EVs & Mobility|Energy & Policy|Markets & Money|Picks & Reviews]"
tags: ["3-5", "relevant", "keywords"]
type: "[quick-take|deep-dive|product-review|best-list|opinion]"
summary: "1-2 sentence preview"
seoTitle: "SEO Title 50-60 chars"
seoDescription: "Meta description 150-160 chars"
image: "https://image-url.com"
imageAlt: "Descriptive alt text"
imageCredit: "Photo by Name on Unsplash"
featured: false
affiliateProducts:  # If applicable
  - name: "Product Name"
    url: "https://amazon.com/dp/ASIN?tag=trendytecht0a-20"
    price: "$XX"
sources:
  - title: "Source Name"
    url: "https://source-url.com"
---
```

---

## Amazon Affiliate URLs

**Always use this format:**
```
https://www.amazon.com/dp/[ASIN]?tag=trendytecht0a-20
```

**Your Tracking ID:** `trendytecht0a-20`

**Never forget the `?tag=` parameter!**

---

## Image Workflow

### Option 1: AI Generated Images (Recommended)

**When to use:** No press release photo available, Unsplash doesn't have what you need

**Generate an image:**
```bash
npm run generate-image "your image description"
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# For a Tesla article
npm run generate-image "Tesla electric vehicle charging at modern station"

# For an AI article
npm run generate-image "AI robot working on computer coding"

# With custom style
npm run generate-image "Solar panels on residential roof" --style photorealistic

# With Replicate (cheaper)
npm run generate-image "5G network technology" --provider replicate
```

The script will:
1. Generate the image using AI (DALL-E 3 or Stable Diffusion)
2. Download it to `/public/images/articles/`
3. Give you the exact frontmatter to copy/paste

**Setup (first time only):**
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add your API key (OpenAI or Replicate)
3. Get keys at:
   - OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys (~$0.04-0.12/image)
   - Replicate: https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens (~$0.005/image)

### Option 2: Unsplash Photos

**When to use:** Need real photos, product shots, people

1. Search Unsplash.com for your topic
2. Copy the image URL
3. Note the photographer name

### Option 3: Press Release Images

**When to use:** Company announcements, product launches

1. Check company press kit or blog post
2. Download image to `/public/images/articles/`
3. Credit the company

## Image Attribution Format

**AI Generated:**
```yaml
image: "/images/articles/tesla-ev-charging-1234567.png"

```

**Unsplash:**
```yaml
image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-..."
imageAlt: "Descriptive alt text"
imageCredit: "Photo by [Photographer Name] on Unsplash"
```

**Press Release:**
```yaml
image: "/images/articles/company-product-photo.jpg"
imageAlt: "Descriptive alt text"
imageCredit: "Image courtesy of [Company Name]"
```
