IMAGE SOURCING DECISION GUIDE:

For BEST-LIST articles, prioritize:

1. BEST: Hero product image (#1 "Best Overall")
   - Get actual product image from Amazon (Best Overall pick)
   - Shows readers what your top recommendation looks like
   - Credit: "Product image courtesy of Amazon.com"

2. GOOD: Composite image of top 3-4 products
   - AI-generated: "Product comparison showing [product names], professional layout, white background"
   - Or manually create collage of product images
   - Credit: "Composite image" or "AI Generated Image"

3. ACCEPTABLE: Category-specific Unsplash image
   - Search for SPECIFIC products, not generic category
   - Example: "wireless earbuds close up" not "technology"
   - Credit: "Photo by [Name] on Unsplash"

NEVER:
- Generic "tech gadgets" stock photos
- Unrelated images
- Images that don't show products from the list
- Reuse same image from another article
