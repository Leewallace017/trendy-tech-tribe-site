<!--
IMAGE SOURCING DECISION GUIDE:

For NEWS/QUICK-TAKE articles, prioritize:

1. BEST: Official press release image
   - Check company newsroom for official photos
   - Product launch photos, event photos, etc.
   - Credit: "Image courtesy of [Company Name]"

2. GOOD: AI-generated conceptual image
   - Prompt based on news topic
   - Example: "Modern [company] headquarters, professional photography"
   - Example: "Abstract visualization of [technology], tech journalism style"
   - Credit: "AI Generated Image"

3. ACCEPTABLE: Specific Unsplash search
   - Search for specific company, product, or concept
   - NOT generic "technology" or "business"
   - Example: "Google office" for Google news, not "tech office"
   - Credit: "Photo by [Name] on Unsplash"

NEVER:
- Completely unrelated stock photos
- Generic images that don't connect to story
- Images that have been used in other articles
