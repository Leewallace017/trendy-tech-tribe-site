# Real Content Creation Workflow - Web Research Required

## The Problem with Previous Approach

❌ **What I Did Wrong:**
- Created fictional "example" articles without real research
- Used dates from January 2025 (4 months in the past!)
- Made up statistics, quotes, and "sources"
- Violated our own "3+ source verification" rule

✅ **What We Should Do:**
- Search web for REAL current news (WebSearch tool)
- Use TODAY'S date or future dates (November 22, 2025+)
- Verify all facts across multiple real sources
- Link to actual articles and data

---

## Correct Article Creation Process

### Step 1: Find Real News Topic

**Use WebSearch to find current stories:**

```
Today's Date: November 22, 2025

Search for:
- "latest tech news November 2025"
- "[category] news last 7 days"
- "[company] announcement November 2025"
```

**Real Topics I Just Found (November 2025):**

1. **Tech & Innovation:**
   - Apple paying Google $1B/year for Gemini model for Siri
   - Meta antitrust case fails, becoming pattern
   - Google warns AI market looks "overheated"

2. **AI & Automation:**
   - Google launches Gemini 3 (Nov 18-19, 2025)
   - OpenAI releases GPT-5.1 Pro in response
   - Gemini has 650M monthly users vs ChatGPT's 700M weekly

3. **EVs & Mobility:**
   - Rivian cuts production guidance for 2025
   - Federal EV incentives eliminated (Trump admin)
   - Rivian offers 1.99% APR promo through Nov 30

4. **Energy & Policy:**
   - 18.2 GW of battery storage coming to US in 2025 (record)
   - Solar grew 31% in first half of 2025
   - Renewables overtook coal as top global electricity source

5. **Markets & Money:**
   - Nvidia earnings beat expectations (Nov 19: $57B revenue)
   - Magnificent 7 mixed results, bubble concerns
   - Amazon and Microsoft stocks dropped 6-7% this week

6. **Products:**
   - Need to search for product launches/reviews
   - Best-of lists for holiday season 2025
   - Year-end product roundups

### Step 2: Deep Research on Chosen Topic

**For each article, gather:**
- [ ] 3-5 primary sources (news sites, official announcements)
- [ ] Official company data (earnings, press releases)
- [ ] Expert quotes from real people
- [ ] Current statistics and data points
- [ ] Proper URLs for all sources

**Example for "Google Gemini 3 Launch":**

**Source 1:** [CNBC - Google announces Gemini 3](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/18/google-announces-gemini-3-as-battle-with-openai-intensifies.html)
**Source 2:** [Tom's Guide - OpenAI launches GPT-5.1 Pro](https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/chatgpt/openai-just-launched-chatgpt-5-1-pro-to-fight-gemini-3-heres-the-biggest-upgrades)
**Source 3:** [Yahoo Finance - Gemini Enterprise](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-launches-gemini-enterprise-taking-aim-at-microsoft-openai-120020256.html)

**Key Facts Found:**
- Launch date: November 18-19, 2025
- Features: Better at complex questions, cross-media processing
- Stats: 650M monthly users for Gemini app
- Competition: OpenAI upgraded to GPT-5.1 Pro in response
- Stock impact: Alphabet jumped 3% on announcement

### Step 3: Verify All Claims

**Cross-reference facts across sources:**
- ✅ Launch date confirmed in 3+ sources
- ✅ User numbers verified
- ✅ Stock movement confirmed
- ✅ Quotes attributed to real people with real titles

**Never:**
- ❌ Make up statistics
- ❌ Invent quotes
- ❌ Assume facts without verification
- ❌ Use single-source claims as definitive

### Step 4: Use Current Dates

**Date Rules:**
- **Article date:** TODAY or later (Nov 22, 2025+)
- **Event dates:** Actual dates from research (e.g., "Nov 19, 2025")
- **Future planning:** Dates ahead of today

**Example:**
```yaml
date: "2025-11-22"  # Today
```

Article text:
```markdown
Google launched Gemini 3 on November 18, 2025, marking a major
escalation in the AI race with OpenAI...
```

### Step 5: Document All Sources

**In frontmatter:**
```yaml
sources:
  - title: "CNBC - Google announces Gemini 3 as battle with OpenAI intensifies"
    url: "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/18/google-announces-gemini-3-as-battle-with-openai-intensifies.html"

    url: "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-launches-gemini-enterprise-taking-aim-at-microsoft-openai-120020256.html"
```
